  <h1>WHAT KIND OF ASSOCIATION ARE WE?</h1>

  <p>The Bolk is one of the smaller associations in Delft where all members know each other. There is a homely and relaxed atmosphere, so you can be yourself. The unique thing about our association is that the members are very diverse, but are open to others. At one moment you can participate in a sing-along and a debate evening, and at another you can go sailing for the weekend.</p>
  <p>Our club is located near the station and the city center. Bolkers can usually be found at the bar for a beer and a sandwich or in the back for a board game.</p>
  <p>Because The Bolk is so diverse, there are many different committees. Together they keep our beautiful association going. In the second quarter of the academic year you can also gain some committee experience in a first-year committee. Take care of a meal or organize a party or a sailing weekend for your fellow freshmen! After this you can decide if you would like to be part of one of our committees. For an overview of all committees, check <a href="https://website.debolk.nl/commissies/" target="_blank">the association site: "Commisies"</a>.</p>
  <p>Our members are not only concerned with all these cool things, we also have to study, of course. Being a member at the Bolk can easily be combined with your studies. We do not impose obligations that can impede you from studying. Furthermore, as a first-year you have contact with all members of the Bolk, and therefore with the senior students you can turn to for help.</p>
  <p>We are also active in sailing and maintaining our botter Trui. A botter is a sailboat originally intended for fishing. Trui was built in 1875 and recognized as a sailing monument. During the KennisMakingsTijd (KMT) you will also sail with Trui. Look for more information on her website, <a href="https://bu130.nl" target="_blank">www.bu130.nl</a></p>
